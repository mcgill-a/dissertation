\section{Critical Evaluation}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Took too long trying to get a baseline model with LSTM. Should've switched to GRU sooner.
    \item The data I originally collected was rubbish for NMT. Should've thought about this before.
    \item The models couldn't use all the data I had available because of available computing power. Ideally would've used a better GPU
    \item Models still work quite well but I think this is due to the limited variety of the datasets. Would've been good to use the same data as other papers to have a direct comparison.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Future Work}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Try with LSTM instead of GRU
    \item Use Luong \cite{luong_effective_2015} attention instead of Bahdanau \cite{bahdanau_neural_2016} attention
    \item Try more data with larger vocab sizes
    \item Adjust learning rate over time with each epoch
    \item Link the models to an interactive web interface like Google Translate
\end{itemize}
