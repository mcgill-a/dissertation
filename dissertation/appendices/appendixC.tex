\subsubsection{Supervisor Meeting 1 - 28/09/2019}
This week we discussed the initial project overview that I had prepared beforehand. Dimitra gave me some alterations to clarify some minor details and provide more information sources for the context of the project.
%We also spoke about the upcoming deadlines such as the week 9 report and what will be included in it.
Dimitra suggested that for next week I should create two tables of academic references. One for papers relating to machine translation of Scottish Gaelic and the other for papers about machine translation for other low resource languages. Including the approaches and results on the tables should help identify methods that can be applied to Scottish Gaelic.


\subsubsection{Supervisor Meeting 2 - 04/10/2019}
We spoke about the reference tables I created for previous low resource machine translation research. The tables revealed that there is no published work on neural machine translation that has focuses on Scottish Gaelic. Most of the papers for low resource languages use various types of transfer learning so we decided that transfer learning should be the focus of the experiments.

Dimitra suggested that for next week I should aim to have made some progress on the introduction and plan out the structure of the dissertation (sections, headings and sub-headings). We also discussed more information sources that could be used for gathering training data such as the Scottish parliament website so I will look into these by the next meeting as well.


\subsubsection{Supervisor Meeting 3 - 11/10/2019}
We went over and made a few changes to the dissertation contents page structure I that created which includes the different sections I expect to cover in the dissertation. We also went over my dissertation introduction section and Dimitra gave a lot of helpful feedback which mainly involved adding more examples and explanations for various statements to give more context. For example, for the problem statement part I need to explain the importance of the issue and clarify what impact solving the problem could result in.

For next week I will make the changes to my introduction and ideally have made some good progress on the first draft of my literature review. 

\subsubsection{Supervisor Meeting 4 - 18/10/2019}
Over the past week I had made a start on the literature review, focussing on the low-resource translation approaches section. Dimitra read over it and gave me some feedback such as to add more diagrams, avoid direct quotations, and focus on explaining what the references found rather than criticising their findings. I also need to mention any figures in the text to bring the readerâ€™s attention to them.

I also added some more information to the introduction as Dimitra recommended during our last meeting. The extra information gives more context to the project by clarifying why low-resource languages achieve poor results for neural machine translation. 

For next week we agreed that I should work on the Gaelic section of the literature review and get started on the machine translation section.
