This template has been appositely tweaked for writing theses or dissertations in Overleaf/Sharelatex, but it makes a good general purpose template too.

[Here's an example](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dissertate.io/generic.pdf)
of the original Dissertate template. However, this version is slighly different, uses different Latex packages and was customised using the Napier University brand colours.

#### Usage ####
Simply download the ZIP of this project via the green button at the top right, then import it in your favourite editor (e.g. Overleaf) and start writing!

Make sure to use the <b>XeLaTeX</b> compiler. In Overleaf, you can change this from the sidebar menu.


#### Advantages ####
One of the biggest hurdles in submitting a thesis or dissertation is getting the formatting right — the rules are arcane, and the registrar is pedantic. Few students have the background needed to design and typeset clean and stylish documents. Enter Dissertate. Dissertate is a set of beautiful LaTeX templates for a thesis or dissertation. To date, the software provides everything needed to support the production and typesetting of a PhD dissertation at Harvard, Princeton, NYU, and UC Berkeley, though it will be adapted to meet the requirements of other schools — eventually all of them. The format and styling are based closely on the requirements published by each university's registrar.
